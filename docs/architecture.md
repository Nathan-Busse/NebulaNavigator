# Nebula Navigator Architecture Documentation

Nebula Navigator is an AI-powered, interactive tool that transforms code repository analysis into an immersive 3D experience. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, its key components, data flow, technology stack, and future possibilities.

---

## 1. Overview

Nebula Navigator converts static repository data into a dynamic 3D galaxy where each node represents a file or module, and interconnecting lines reveal dependencies. The system leverages AI-driven code analysis along with procedural vector terrain generation using Perlin noise to offer real-time insights into code quality and structure.

## 2. System Components

### 2.1 Backend API

- **Purpose:**  
  - Aggregate repository data from sources like GitHub/GitLab.
  - Process code analysis using AI models to generate insights (code quality, potential issues, recommendations).
  - Generate vector terrain data using a Perlin noise algorithm, mapping noise values to abstract "elevations" that reflect repository activity or health.

- **Key Components:**
  - **Server:** Built in Python using Flask (or FastAPI).
  - **Endpoints:**  
    - `/api/terrain`: Accepts query parameters (width, height, scale, octaves, persistence, lacunarity) and returns JSON data representing the generated terrain.
    - Other endpoints for repository data and AI insights.
  - **Modules:**  
    - `app.py`: Main entry point handling HTTP requests.
    - `utils/code_analysis.py`: Contains AI analysis functions.
    - Configuration files and requirements in `config.py` and `requirements.txt`.

- **Location:** `src/backend/`

### 2.2 Frontend Visualization

- **Purpose:**  
  - Render a dynamic 3D galaxy representing the code repository.
  - Provide intuitive user interaction through mouse and touch gestures.
  - Display overlays with detailed insights when nodes are selected.

- **Key Components:**
  - **Rendering Engine:** Utilizes Three.js to create and animate 3D objects.
  - **User Interface:**  
    - Interactive control panels (for filtering, searching, and settings).
    - Detailed pop-ups for individual nodes, showcasing file attributes and AI-driven analysis.
  - **Interaction Libraries:**  
    - May include OrbitControls or gesture libraries (e.g., Hammer.js) to support smooth navigation.

- **Location:** `src/frontend/`

### 2.3 AI-Driven Insights & Data Processing

- **Purpose:**  
  - Analyze repository code to detect issues, assess code quality, and provide actionable recommendations.
  - Support the visualization layer by supplying data used in overlays and dynamic updates.

- **Key Components:**
  - AI modules integrated into the backend using libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or transformer-based models like GPT-4/CodeBERT.
  - Data aggregation functions that compile commit histories, file metrics, and dependency data for real-time updates.

---

## 3. Data Flow & Communication

1. **User Interaction:**  
   - The user navigates the 3D galaxy using touch or mouse inputs.
   - Selections or filter adjustments trigger API calls from the frontend.

2. **Backend Processing:**  
   - API endpoints process requestsâ€”generating terrain data via Perlin noise, aggregating repository information, and performing AI analysis.
   - Data is formatted as JSON responses.

3. **Frontend Rendering:**  
   - The frontend receives JSON data and dynamically updates the visualization (e.g., adjusting node properties, updating overlays with analysis).
   - Real-time communication (using AJAX or potentially WebSocket connections) ensures that the display remains up-to-date.

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Backend:**  
  - Language: Python  
  - Framework: Flask or FastAPI  
  - Libraries: NumPy, noise (for Perlin noise), AI frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  
- **Frontend:**  
  - Rendering: Three.js  
  - Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optionally React for richer UI components)  
  - Interaction: Gesture libraries (e.g., Hammer.js) for touch support

- **Data Processing & Integration:**  
  - RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend  
  - JSON as the data exchange format

## 6. Scalability, Security, and Future Enhancements

- **Scalability:**  
  - Modular design facilitates the addition of new features (e.g., enhanced AI models, collaborative tools).
  - Efficient handling of real-time updates ensures a smooth user experience as the repository grows.

- **Security:**  
  - Basic API security measures are in place, with recommendations to implement authentication and secure access if exposed externally.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Integration of VR/AR modes for a more immersive experience.
  - Enhanced collaboration features for real-time multi-user annotations.
  - Expansion to support additional repository hosting platforms and CI/CD integrations.
  - Continuous improvements in AI-driven code quality assessments.
