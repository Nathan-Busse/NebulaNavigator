# Nebula Navigator

Nebula Navigator is an AI-powered interactive tool that transforms code repository analysis into an immersive 3D experience. By visualizing your code as a dynamic galaxy, the tool provides cutting-edge insights into code quality, structure, and dependencies. Its core features—such as vector terrain rendering using Perlin noise and real-time AI-driven analysis—enable seamless navigation and deep understanding of complex codebases.

## Overview

Nebula Navigator reimagines the way developers explore code repositories. It converts static code data into a visually engaging 3D galaxy where each node represents a file or module, and their interconnections reveal dependencies and architectural nuances. With AI-driven code analysis and an optional vector terrain overlay using Perlin noise, this tool empowers developers to quickly spot issues, track changes, and optimize project structure.

---

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualization:**  
  Explore your repository as a richly detailed galaxy. Nodes (representing files or modules) and connections (dependencies) are rendered in real time, supporting fluid zooming, panning, and rotation.

- **AI-Driven Insights:**  
  Automatically analyze code quality, detect potential issues, and receive actionable recommendations.

- **Vector Terrain Generation:**  
  Use a Perlin noise algorithm to create a vector terrain overlay that abstractly represents repository health and activity density.

- **Responsive & Accessible UI:**  
  Designed to work seamlessly with mouse inputs and touch gestures, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

- **Dynamic Data Integration:**  
  Live updates reflecting commit histories, file changes, and analysis results keep you always in tune with your project’s evolution.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:**  
  - Python (Flask or FastAPI) for API endpoints and AI integration  
  - AI libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, or transformer-based models) for code analysis  
  - Third-party integrations for repository data (e.g., GitHub/GitLab APIs)

- **Frontend:**  
  - Three.js for 3D interactive visualizations  
  - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (or React) for a modern, responsive UI  
  - Gesture libraries (e.g., Hammer.js) to support touch interfaces

- **Data Processing:**  
  - NumPy and the `noise` library for Perlin noise terrain generation

---

## Project Architecture

The project is divided into three core components:

1. **Backend API:**  
   - Aggregates repository data and processes AI analysis  
   - Exposes endpoints such as `/api/terrain` for vector terrain generation based on Perlin noise

2. **Visualization Engine:**  
   - Renders a 3D universe where each node represents code elements  
   - Handles smooth animations, sensor inputs (mouse/touch), and dynamic data updates

3. **User Interface:**  
   - Provides an intuitive control panel for filtering, searching, and settings adjustments  
   - Displays detailed overlays with repository insights when nodes are selected

For an in-depth architectural overview, refer to the documentation in `docs/architecture.md`.

## Installation & Setup

### Backend

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nathan-Busse/NebulaNavigator.git
   cd NebulaNavigator/src/backend
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend

1. **Open the Frontend:**
   - Navigate to `src/frontend` and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

---

## Usage

- **3D Exploration:** Navigate the 3D galaxy using mouse drag or touch gestures. Zoom in on nodes to view details.
- **Data Visualization:** See real-time changes reflected in the visualization as new commits or code modifications are processed.
- **AI Insights:** Click on any node to open an overlay with in-depth AI-generated code analysis, diagnostics, and recommendations.
- **Vector Terrain:** Toggle the vector terrain overlay to interpret repository density and activity levels through Perlin noise–generated graphics.

---

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced AI Models:** Further improve code quality assessment and anomaly detection.
- **Bi-Directional Views:** Integrate both 3D and 2D modes for flexible analysis.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Enable multi-user annotations and real-time collaboration within the visualization.
- **Extended Platform Support:** Expand compatibility with additional version control and CI/CD platforms.
